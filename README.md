Data processing and visualisation in Python

All codes are contain within Jupyter files.
Make sure all datasets are within the same folder before running jupyter through terminal.
 
Within Jupyter file, not all block of codes create my final visuals.
 
- In file “map_plot.ipynb” only the last block of codes generate the map visualisation. All blocks before are just progresses leading to my final plot.  
- In file “graph_plot.ipynb” only the last 2 block of code produce both of my graph visuals.
- In file “VAT.ipynb” all code is relevant to produce the VAT plot visual.
